# Getting Started

You can start using Pixiâ€™VN by initializing a new project.

## Prerequisites

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 18 or higher.
* Text Editor with TypeScript support.
  * [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is recommended.

## Project Initialization

To initialize a new project, you can use the following command:

```bash
# npm
npm create pixi-vn@latest

# yarn
yarn create pixi-vn

# pnpm
pnpm create pixi-vn

# bun
bun create pixi-vn

# bun
deno init --npm pixi-vn
```

The supported template presets are:

* **[Basic Visual Novel - Web page (Vite + React + MUI joy)](https://github.com/DRincs-Productions/pixi-vn-react-template)**
* **[Basic Visual Novel - Multi Device (Vite + React + MUI joy + Electron Forge)](https://github.com/DRincs-Productions/pixi-vn-react-template/tree/electron)**

( More templates will be added in the future, see this [issue](https://github.com/DRincs-Productions/pixi-vn/issues/162) for more information )

After the project is initialized, you can open the project directory with your text editor (VSCode is recommended) and start developing your visual novel.

Into all templates there is a `README.md` file with more information about the project.
